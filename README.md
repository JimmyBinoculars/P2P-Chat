# P2P Hyper-Encrypted chat
## How it is going to work
The clients will share ips for the first time then message each other both clients will then regester each other's identifiers.
Using a key that needs to be shared to the other client they can send encrypted messages to each other. The only server part is
for generating keys for encrypting identifiers.
